# conjugate-bayes
Calculate posterior distribution based on conjugates in Bayesian Statistics. This repo includes the most common conjugate classes that allow you to easily calculate a posterior without simulation (e.g. Metropolis?Hastings algorithm, Gibbs Sampling) or variational Bayes methods.

An example of how to run it is included in the `example.py` file. The requirements can be installed via pip with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
